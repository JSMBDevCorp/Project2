# STOCKWATCH

## Description 

Tracking stocks is a tedious task and many stock apps have an overly complicated UI.  When it comes to trading stocks, we only care about 2 things: when to buy and when to sell.

Our app allows users to track an unlimited amount of stocks and filter their tracked stocks based on buy and sell price limits. This allows our user to quickly make purchase/sell decisions on multiple stocks rather than tracking each one individually.

Our goal: make tracking, buying and selling multiple stocks simple.


## User Story

As a novice or professional stock trader, I want to track multiple stock prices without having to check each stock individually. 
With so many stocks to track, StockWatch can be used to filter the stocks based on a buy and sell opportunities.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
